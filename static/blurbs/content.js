    yogi: "Years ago, I was in need of some very concrete ways to take care of myself and be the person I knew I needed to be. I figured an exercise that ended in the fetal position was a good starting place! Turns out there's actually A LOT of work before you get to lay around! In addition to my faith, my yoga practice has created an inner and outer strength that I now enjoy every day.",
    father: "Having 3 boys (middle pictured here) is the true work and joy in my life. They're more than a handful for sure, but I can't imagine anything different! They keep me on my toes, and always reaching to be the compassionate person I am called to be. They are all completely awesome in their own uniquely amazing ways.",
    'software-engineer': "I love creating, learning and honing my craft. I started in back end web a few years back but quickly picked up front end work on the fly during my first gig. Since then I've loved the challenge that comes from working on both sides of the stack. So far I've mostly worked with React and Java microservices, but I'm excited to keep learning more!",
    music: "In a past life I could be found around St. Louis peddling my music wherever I could. I wrote some great tunes, got some good local press, and had quite a few adventues. (And several missadventues.) It was a good run!",
    launchCode: <section>When music ended, I didn't have the time or money to go back to school, but had heard about LaunchCode. It was truly life changing. They gave me all the resources I needed and got me to my first tech job. Learn more at <a href="http://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode.org</a>.</section>
