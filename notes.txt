// TODOs: 

----Styles-----

1. Do not control borders of main header with "max-width"--
    instead use contaning div for border thickness.

2. Consider basing font on viewport attributes

3. (Once styles are more fixed) refactor styles using vars

4. (Once BASIC design is more fixed) choose a simple 4 color color pallete

---Future Design Features (in order of priority) ---

1. Opposite Circle object to mirror main header: Where I've been
    Main features: 
        a. Swipeable left to rigth for 3-4 different pictures / icons
            i. Each picture has left-side blurb 

2. Top Navbar for quick links to other apps - 
    a. consider tidal "what I've been listening to" mini app for fun
    b. family picture slideshow utilizing dropbox API? Pretty lame.
